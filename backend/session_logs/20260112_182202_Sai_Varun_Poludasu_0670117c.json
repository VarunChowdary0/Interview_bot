I hope you're having a good day so far, and thanks for taking the time to connect with us at TechCorp.\n\nLooking at your chat-room project where you used Web Sockets and Node.js, let's say you needed to add a feature where users can send emoji reactions to messages. You have a message object like this: `{id: 123, content: 'Hello everyone!', reactions: []}`. Can you write a JavaScript function that takes a message object, an emoji string, and a user ID, and adds the reaction to the message? If the same user tries to add the same emoji again, it should remove their previous reaction instead.",
